# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to configure their line access permissions through a dedicated settings page. Users can select which production lines they have access to from a filterable card-based interface. New users are automatically redirected to this configuration page after registration if no line access has been configured. The feature integrates with the existing UserLineAccess model and provides a seamless user experience through menu navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be automatically redirected to the line access configuration page after login if I haven't configured my line access yet, so that I can set up my permissions before accessing the production system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in AND has no UserLineAccess records THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the line access configuration page
2. WHEN a user completes the line access configuration THEN the system SHALL redirect them to http://127.0.0.1:8001/production/line-select/
3. IF a user has existing UserLineAccess records THEN the system SHALL allow normal login flow without redirection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a line access configuration page from the menu bar, so that I can update my line permissions at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page with the menu bar THEN the system SHALL display a "Line Access Settings" link in the menu
2. WHEN clicking the "Line Access Settings" menu item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the line access configuration page
3. WHEN on the line access configuration page THEN the system SHALL display the current page as active in the menu

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all available production lines displayed as cards with name and description, so that I can easily identify and select the lines I need access to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the line access configuration page THEN the system SHALL display all production lines as cards
2. WHEN displaying line cards THEN each card SHALL show the line name and description
3. WHEN displaying line cards THEN the system SHALL indicate which lines the user currently has access to
4. WHEN clicking on a line card THEN the system SHALL toggle the user's access to that line

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter the line list by typing in a search input, so that I can quickly find specific lines when there are many available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the line access configuration page THEN the system SHALL display a search input field above the line cards
2. WHEN typing in the search input THEN the system SHALL filter line cards in real-time based on name and description
3. WHEN the search input is empty THEN the system SHALL display all available lines
4. WHEN no lines match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "No lines found" message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my line access configuration, so that my selections are persisted and applied to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making line access selections THEN the system SHALL provide a "Save" button
2. WHEN clicking the "Save" button THEN the system SHALL update the UserLineAccess records for the current user
3. WHEN saving is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message
4. IF saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the current selections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want bulk selection options for line access, so that I can quickly select or deselect all lines without clicking each one individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the line access configuration page THEN the system SHALL display "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons
2. WHEN clicking "Select All" THEN the system SHALL select all visible lines (after filtering)
3. WHEN clicking "Deselect All" THEN the system SHALL deselect all visible lines (after filtering)
4. WHEN using bulk selection THEN the system SHALL update the visual state of all affected line cards

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage other users' line access permissions, so that I can control which production lines each user can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logged in as an administrator THEN the system SHALL display an "Admin" section in the menu bar
2. WHEN accessing the admin section THEN the system SHALL display a "Manage User Access" option
3. WHEN viewing the user access management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all users
4. WHEN selecting a user THEN the system SHALL display their current line access configuration
5. WHEN modifying a user's line access as an administrator THEN the system SHALL save the changes to that user's UserLineAccess records
6. WHEN saving changes as an administrator THEN the system SHALL log the administrator's action

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the line access configuration to work seamlessly with Docker Compose deployment, so that the feature functions correctly in the containerized environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed using Docker Compose THEN the line access configuration feature SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN accessing the configuration page in Docker environment THEN all URLs and redirects SHALL work properly
3. WHEN saving line access configuration in Docker environment THEN the database updates SHALL persist correctly
