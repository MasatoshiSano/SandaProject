# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to control the dashboard display through an admin interface. Administrators can configure which cards are visible on the dashboard, hide specific cards, and set the display order of cards. This provides flexibility in customizing the dashboard layout based on organizational needs and user preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access a dashboard card configuration interface through the admin panel, so that I can manage dashboard card settings centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a "Dashboard Card Settings" section
2. WHEN an administrator clicks on the dashboard card settings THEN the system SHALL show a list of all available dashboard cards
3. IF the administrator has proper permissions THEN the system SHALL allow access to card configuration features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to toggle the visibility of individual dashboard cards, so that I can control which information is displayed to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the card configuration list THEN the system SHALL display each card with a visibility toggle option
2. WHEN an administrator toggles a card's visibility to "hidden" THEN the system SHALL save this setting and hide the card from the dashboard
3. WHEN an administrator toggles a card's visibility to "visible" THEN the system SHALL save this setting and show the card on the dashboard
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL only display cards marked as visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to set the display order of dashboard cards, so that I can prioritize important information and create a logical layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the card configuration interface THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to reorder cards
2. WHEN an administrator changes the order of cards THEN the system SHALL save the new order settings
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display visible cards in the configured order
4. WHEN no custom order is set THEN the system SHALL use a default ordering system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the card configuration changes to take effect immediately, so that I can see the results of my changes without system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator saves card configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately
2. WHEN users refresh their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the updated card configuration
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL not require application restart or cache clearing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want to see only the cards that administrators have configured as visible, so that my dashboard shows relevant and organized information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only cards marked as visible by administrators
2. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show cards in the order configured by administrators
3. WHEN no cards are configured as visible THEN the system SHALL display a default message or fallback content
4. WHEN card configurations change THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes on the user's next dashboard access
